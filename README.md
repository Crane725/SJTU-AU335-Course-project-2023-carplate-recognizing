# SJTU-AU335-Course-project-2023-carplate-recognizing
Base on traditional ways for chinese blued car plate characters recognizing by matlab.<br>
Images not in .\Samples\ are all for testing.<br>
Some Samples may need to be optimized.<br>
Not perfect for widely use, but still has not bad results.<br>
Everyone sees it has the rights for copying, modifying and spreading. But no illegal utilizing like criminal ways.<br>
If anyone has better ideas in this project please touch me in cranekiyoe229@sjtu.edu.cn, 957796480@qq.com or cranezhy@gmail.com. I really appreciate that.
